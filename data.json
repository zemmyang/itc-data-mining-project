This Act requires all roofing contractors to register with the Construction Industries Board. This requires, in part, for roofers to: prove they have a Certificate of General Liability Insurance, Certificate of Workers Compensation Insurance, Certificate of Good Standing from the Oklahoma Secretary of State, Certificate of Fictitious Trade Name, and supply passport photos and an affidavit verifying lawful presence in the United States.
